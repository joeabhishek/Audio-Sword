v2.2.0:
- Improve background notifications
- Improve related UI

Uses Glass Companion Bluetooth protocol to connect to Google Glass Explorer Edition and control the native ui/interface using the Â©Myo Gesture Control Armband (thalmic.com/myo).

This is a basic proof of concept and should not be considered the best practice for a gesture based HUD interface. Gesture are mapped directly the comparable gestures on the Glass trackpad. For example, wave right to swipe the card to the right.

Myo Pose        Glass Touchpad Command
======================================
Double Tap      Unlock Myo
Wave Right      Swipe Right
Wave Left       Swipe Left
Fist            Tap/Select
Fingers Spread  Swipe Down/Go Back

How to use:

1. Ensure MyGlass app and background processes are not running (Kill from Android Application Manager).
2. Run this app.
3. Myo and Glass will be found automatically if you have paired with them before. In this case, skip steps 4 and 5.
4. Press 'Choose Myo' to connect to your Myo device.
5. Press 'Choose Glass' to connect to your Glass device. Glass must be paired to continue.
6. Perform the 'Unlock' pose (Double-Tap) to enable Myo control of Glass for two seconds, turning the app's icon from gray (off/neutral) to blue (active). When Myo is unlocked, additional gestures will continue to allow Myo to control Glass for 2 seconds.
7. Gestures should be shown on phone UI, and commands send to the Glass device. Glass must be awake/active to respond to touch commands.

Limitations:

Currently no way to wake Glass up from Myo gestures. Glass features that rely on a phone connection (such as GPS) will not work since the MyGlass application cannot be running at the same time.
